\f4 \cf0 Chicken of the VNC is a VNC client for Mac OS X.  A VNC client allows one to display and interact with a remote computer screen.  In other words, you can use Chicken of the VNC to interact with a remote computer as though it's right next to you.\
\
Chicken of the VNC was written by Helmut Maierhofer for OpenStep on Intel and Jason Harris (the author of this document) ported it to the Cocoa API on Mac OS X.  Helmut's original version was called VNCViewer, but as there are already several VNC programs on Mac OS X with this name, I decided to save some confusion and call it by this horrible Chicken name instead.  \
\
More information about VNC can be found at AT&T's compendium: \cf3 http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/\cf0 .  \

\f4\fs20 \cf5 Note:  If you have used a version of Chicken of the VNC prior to 1.3, you will need to either delete your preferences (in ~/Library/Preferences/com.geekspiff.chickenofthevnc.plist), or reset the modifier key mappings in all of your stored profiles.  If you wish, you may also delete the "Chicken of the VNC" folder in your preferences, as it is no longer used.\

\fs24 \cf0 \
Use it just like any other VNC client - enter the address of a working VNC server, the display number (or port) and your password and rock'n'roll...\

\f3\b \cf6 Host:  
\f4\b0 The host to which you wish to connect.  This can be either a DNS name (like myserver.com) or an IP address.  You must be able to "ping" the host to connect to it.\

\f3\b \cf6 Display/Port:
\f4\b0   The display number or port for the connection.  \cf0 VNC server programs on Windows machines tend to default to display number 0, while older VNC servers on Mac OS X, such as OSXvnc version 0.7, tend to use display number 1.  If you can't connect, you can try switching the display number between these two values.  Display numbers less than 100 are interpreted as a port number.  If you're having problems connecting, you should make sure that the port is not firewalled on the server machine.  The port number is 5900 plus the display number - in other words, display zero is port 5900, display one is port 5901, etc.\
\

\f3\b \cf6 Password:

\f4\b0 If checked, the password will be stored in your Keychain and remembered for later use.\

\f3\b \cf6 Profile:  
\f4\b0 The connection profile to use when connecting to this server.  See the section below for more info about connection profiles.\

\f4 You can use profiles to store settings for an individual VNC server or for a class of servers.  For example, you might want to use full-color display for a server that is on your local area network, but drop down to 8-bit display for a remote machine.  \
\
You can also use profiles to specify your default encoding.  VNC operates by transferring an image of the screen from the server to the client.  This obviously requires lots of bandwidth.  The better the encoding that you use to transfer this information, the less "lag" you'll experience while using the Chicken.  \
\
The different encodings are (in rough order of efficiency)\

\f4\b0 A list of profiles that are available to use for your connections.  Add a new profile by typing its name below the list and pressing

\
\cf0 \'a5 
\f3\b \cf6 RFB-Pixelformat:  
\f4\b0 The color resolution to use for the connection.  Because VNC requires large amounts of bandwidth, a more responsive connection can be obtained by using lower color resolution.  
\f3\b Server Native
\f4\b0  uses whatever color resolution the server is using.  8-bit converts colors to grayscale, 16-bit uses thousands of colors, and 24-bit uses millions.\

\f3\b \cf6 Encoding:  
\f4\b0 The encoding to use for the connection.  Encodings are described above.  Use the arrows on the right to change the order of preferred encodings.

\f3\b CopyRect Encoding
\f4\b0  is an optimization that's useful in some situations.  If you're connecting to a very old server, you may wish to turn it off, but we haven't run across any situations where it isn't supported.\

If you are one of those cursed with a single button mouse, you can emulate the right button by quickly tapping the 
\f3\b Shift
\f4\b0  key on your keyboard.  The mouse pointer will change to indicate that clicks will act like the third (right) mouse button.  Likewise, you can emulate the middle button by quickly tapping the 
\f3\b Alt
\f4\b0  (sometimes called Option) key on your keyboard.  To cancel emulation, tap the key a second time or wait for the time interval specified in 
\f3\b Emulation Timeout
\f4\b0 .\
\
If you have a two-button mouse and wish to emulate a third-button click, press both buttons simultaneously.  You can adjust how close together the presses must occur by tweaking the 
\f3\b 3-Button Mouse Emulation Timeout
\f4\b0  setting.\
\
If you are lucky enough to have a two or three button mouse, you don't need to worry about emulation as Chicken of the VNC supports up to three mouse buttons, as well as scroll-wheels on compatible servers.\

The Chicken can be toggled in and out of full screen display by pressing the keyboard combination command-option-control-`.  The 'command' key is also known as the 'Apple' key.  The back-quote (`) is the character immediately to the left of the number '1' on American keyboards.  \

While in full screen mode, you cannot interact with the Dock or with any other programs running locally on your Macintosh.

Different operating systems interpret keystrokes to mean different things.  Although standardization is in the works, not all servers are fully standardized.  \
\
Older versions of Chicken of the VNC tried to account for this difficulty by interrupting your VNC session to ask you to type certain keystrokes.  As of Chicken of the VNC version 1.3, this process became automated.\

Windows machines commonly use the CTRL-ALT-DEL keystroke.  You can send this keystroke by choosing "Send Ctrl-Alt-Del" from the "Connection" menu.  If you'd prefer to type the keystroke, you can do this by simply hitting the keys that map to it.  In the default configuration, this is CTRL-CMD-DEL (the CMD key is also referred to as the Apple key).\
\
On machines that don't have a DEL key (such as recent PowerBooks and iBooks), you can use the function key and the ordinary delete key.  In the default configuration, you would use CTRL-CMD-FN-DELETE.\
\
Likewise, to send Alt-F4 on a laptop (where F4 is mapped to sound volume), you can CMD-FN-F4.\
\
You can see additional uses for the Function key at\

\pard\tx1440\tx2880\tx4320\tx5760\tx7200\li940\fi-220\ql\qnatural

\f4\b0 \cf0 - Added a full-screen, auto-scrolling mode and associated preference settings.  \
- Connection windows no longer default to being larger than your main screen.\
- Windows now initially appear scrolled to the top-left instead of the bottom left.\
- You are no longer prompted to type a key without a modifier when you type special characters.  \
- Revamped the text sending engine.\
- Arrow keys are no longer sent twice.\
- Revamped and reorganized the profile window so that it makes more sense for Mac OS X (and follows the Aqua guidelines).  Also, the profile window could now be localized if someone felt the urge to do it (it no longer uses string constants).  However, this change means that previous users will either need to reset their modifier keymappings in all of their profiles, or delete their preferences.\
- Changed the rectangle drawing options in the Preference window so that they more accurately reflect behaviour on Mac OS X.\
- The rectangle drawing options in the Preferences window now show their current value.  Previously, they always showed the default value, although they used whatever value had been set.\
- Synced with Helmut's 1.2.5 release.  This adds the ability to paste a file's path into your VNC window by dragging the corresponding file into the window (untested).\

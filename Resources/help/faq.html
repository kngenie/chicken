	<h1>I Get Strange Characters When I Type</h1>
	
    <p>Chicken tries hard to work with different keyboard layouts. However, not
    all servers will know how to handle all characters which might be on your
    keyboard, especially if the remote computer has a different keyboard layout
    than your current computer.</p>
    
    <p>Note that, by default, Chicken will treat the Option key as Meta or
    Option on the remote computer. If you instead want to use the option key
    to enter special characters by OS X shortcuts, go to the
    <strong>Modifiers</strong> tab in <strong>Connection Profiles</strong> and
    change the setting for the option key to <strong>none (local
    keymap)</strong>. If you still have problems with the keyboard, file a bug
    report on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/chicken/">SourceForge
    page</a></p> </div>

    <h1>Why Can't I Control Click?</h1>

    <p>By default, Chicken interprets control-clicks as right clicks. If you
    need to send a control-click, you can change the emulation for right mouse
    button to something other than control-click, as described
    <a href="#emulation">below</a>.</p>

	<h1>How 'Bout Command-Option-Escape, Control-Alt-Delete and Other Strange Combos?</h1>
	
	<p>You can force-quit applications on a remote Macintosh by sending the CMD-OPT-ESC keystroke from the <strong>Connection</strong> menu's <strong>Special Keys</strong> submenu.</p>

	<p>Likewise, Windows machines commonly use the CTRL-ALT-DEL keystroke.  You can send this keystroke by choosing <strong>Send Ctrl-Alt-Del</strong> from the <strong>Connection</strong> menu's <strong>Special Keys</strong> submenu.  If you'd prefer to type the keystroke, you can do this by simply hitting the keys that map to it.  In the default configuration, this is CTRL-CMD-DEL (the CMD key is also referred to as the Apple key).</p>
	
	<p>On machines that don't have a DEL key (such as laptops), you can use the function key and the ordinary delete key.  In the default configuration, you would use CTRL-CMD-FN-DELETE.</p>

	<p>Similarly, to send Alt-F4 on a laptop (where F4 is mapped to sound volume), you can use CMD-FN-F4.</p>

	<p>You can see additional uses for the Function key on <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Hardware/Developer_Notes/Macintosh_CPUs-G4/17inchPowerBookG4/3Input-Output/chapter_4_section_11.html" target="_blank">Apple's Laptop Technical Pages</a>.</p>
	
	<p>The <strong>Connection</strong> menu's <strong>Special Keys</strong> submenu has several other commonly used keystrokes that are not found on Macintosh keyboards.</p>

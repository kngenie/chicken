	<h1>Full Screen Display</h1>
	
	<p>The Chicken can be toggled in and out of full screen display by pressing the keyboard combination command-option-control-`.  The 'command' key is also known as the 'Apple' key.  The back-quote (`) is the character immediately to the left of the number '1' on American keyboards.</p>

	<p>If this key combination interferes with your work, or is not convenient on international keyboards, it can be changed in the <strong>Keyboard tab of the Preferences</strong>.</p>

	<p>While in full screen mode, you cannot interact with the Dock or with any other programs running locally on your Macintosh.  If the remote screen is larger than your local screen, the display will 'auto-scroll' when the mouse is close the edge of the screen.  The scrolling speed and the presence of scrollbars can be adjusted in the Fullscreen tab of the Preferences.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
	<h1>More About Connections</h1>
	
	<p>The Chicken supports server autodiscovery using Bonjour (formerly known as Rendezvous).  To enable it, select the <strong>Use Bonjour</strong> item in Chicken's application menu.  Servers that advertise themselves using Bonjour will automatically show up in your bookmarks window!</p>
	
	<p>If you wish to connect to a server without using bookmarks, just choose <strong>New Connection</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu.  Of course, if you decide that you want to bookmark the server, you can always check the "Save Server" button before you connect.</p>
	
	<p>You can get back to the bookmarks window you saw when you launched Chicken by selecting <strong>Open Connection</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu.</p>
	
	<p>You can connect to a server that is behind a firewall by using a listening connection.  Choose <strong>Listen for Server</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu and then set the VNC server up to initiate a listening connection to your client machine.</p>

<div class="section">
	<h1>Command Line Usage</h1>
	
	<p>You can use Chicken by calling it from the command line.  To do this, you should 'cd' to the location of Chicken.  Then, do the following:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 2em;"><code>cd Chicken.app/Contents/MacOS/<br />
	./Chicken</code></p>
	
	<p>To get help on command line invocation, add "--help" to the invocation.</p>
